## ðŸ›  How FRAME Works
FRAME follows a **modular approach** to instruction development:

### Behavior & Response Rules
FRAME enforces **strict AI behavior guidelines**, ensuring a **formal and structured response style** with no unnecessary elaboration.

### Instruction Writing Best Practices
FRAME ensures AI instructions are:
- **Explicit** (No ambiguity in system behavior)
- **Modular** (Clearly structured rules)
- **Efficient** (No redundant or conflicting instructions)

### Evaluation & Refinement
FRAME runs **automated checks** on instruction sets:
- Detects **inconsistencies, contradictions, and inefficiencies**.
- Suggests **optimized corrections** to improve clarity and performance.
- Prevents **poorly structured instructions** from affecting AI behavior.
