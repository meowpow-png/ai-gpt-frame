# Input Parsing for FRAME

## Purpose

The purpose of the **Input Parsing** feature is to ensure that the instructions provided to FRAME are interpreted correctly and in a way that aligns with the intended behavior of the custom AI system. The input must be clear, precise, and unambiguous, so that the AI can act on it effectively.

## Steps in Input Parsing

1. **Receiving Input Instructions**:
   - FRAME takes in instructions in textual format (e.g., Markdown or plain text). These instructions could be about defining system behaviors, responses, or other operational rules.
   - Each instruction is treated as a separate entity or rule to be parsed individually.

2. **Initial Parsing**:
   - The input instructions are tokenized and analyzed for structure. Each instruction is broken down into smaller components such as actions, conditions, parameters, and constraints.
   - **Example**: 
     ``` 
     Instruction: "If the user asks for the weather, return the current forecast."
     Parsed components: 
     Action: "return the current forecast"
     Condition: "If the user asks for the weather"
     ```

3. **Checking for Clarity**:
   - FRAME verifies if the instructions are clear and free from ambiguity.
   - If a sentence or instruction can be interpreted in more than one way, FRAME will flag it as ambiguous and require refinement.
   - **Example of Ambiguity**:
     ```
     "If the user asks for help, provide a detailed guide."
     Issue: What constitutes 'detailed'?
     Solution: Frame would suggest specifying what ‘detailed’ means, e.g., "Provide a guide with at least 3 steps."
     ```

4. **Consistency Check**:
   - FRAME checks for consistency between instructions. It ensures that no two instructions contradict each other.
   - If there are conflicting instructions (e.g., "always prioritize user satisfaction" vs. "always provide precise information"), FRAME will flag this as an inconsistency for review.

5. **Handling Undefined Terms**:
   - If an instruction contains terms or actions that are not predefined in the instruction set (e.g., "optimize," "best performance"), FRAME checks whether these terms are properly defined elsewhere.
   - If terms are undefined or unclear, FRAME will prompt the developer to clarify or define them explicitly.

6. **Contextual Understanding**:
   - FRAME understands the context of instructions. For example, instructions that work in one context (e.g., weather forecasting) might need to be adjusted in another (e.g., task management).
   - It will identify the relevant context and ensure the input instructions match the expected behavior for that context.

7. **Syntax and Format Validation**:
   - FRAME also ensures that the instructions follow a standardized format for consistency and ease of processing.
   - It validates the syntax to ensure there are no typographical errors or malformed instructions that could interfere with parsing.

## Common Parsing Issues and Solutions

- **Ambiguity**: 
   - **Problem**: Instructions that are too vague or open to interpretation.
   - **Solution**: Be specific about the conditions, actions, and outcomes. For instance, instead of saying "Provide help," specify the type of help and under what circumstances it should be provided.

- **Contradiction**:
   - **Problem**: Two instructions that conflict with each other.
   - **Solution**: Review the instructions to ensure they align with one another. Clarify priorities and remove any contradictions.

- **Undefined Terms**:
   - **Problem**: Usage of terms that are not defined in the instruction set.
   - **Solution**: Define all terms before using them, or clarify the terms in context to ensure the AI knows how to interpret them.

- **Over-Specification**:
   - **Problem**: Instructions that are overly detailed or prescriptive, making them difficult to follow.
   - **Solution**: Focus on actionable and clear instructions, leaving room for flexibility while maintaining direction.

## Best Practices for Input Instructions

- **Be Clear and Concise**: Instructions should be easy to understand, avoiding complex wording or overly technical jargon unless necessary.
- **Avoid Ambiguity**: Ensure that every instruction has a single, clear meaning. If any part of the instruction can be interpreted in multiple ways, clarify it.
- **Use Defined Terms**: Always ensure that terms used in instructions are well-defined. When introducing new terminology, provide clear definitions.
- **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure that instructions don’t contradict each other. This includes considering overall goals and aligning all instructions with these objectives.
- **Provide Context When Necessary**: If an instruction depends on context (e.g., user intent, environment), be explicit about the conditions under which the instruction applies.

## Conclusion

Effective input parsing ensures that the instructions are interpreted correctly by FRAME and that the AI can behave as intended. By following best practices for clarity, consistency, and definition, developers can create instructions that are actionable, understandable, and reliable for the AI system.
